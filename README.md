# Stem Splitter

A simple web app for splitting an MP3 file into three frequency-based stems (low, mid, high) entirely in the browser. Built with Next.js and `ffmpeg.wasm` so it can run on platforms like Vercel without using any external audio APIs.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features
- Upload MP3 files
- Split into low, mid, and high stems
- Listen to each stem individually
- Download each stem as an MP3
